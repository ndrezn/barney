Wikipedia has a great writeup on [anti-Barney humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Barney_humor). [Depths of Wikipedia](https://www.instagram.com/depthsofwikipedia/) had [some questions about it](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRsMyjlDt_j/), leading to a poll asking folks about what anti-Barney humor they remember, and which aspects they practiced. These scripts visualize the results of those polls.
